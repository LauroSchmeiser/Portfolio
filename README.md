# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!  
Here you’ll find a selection of my projects, showcasing my skills in game-development and design.

Please note:
- For ownership and confidentiality reasons, some projects feature **visual materials** (like posters, trailers, or previews) instead of source code.
- A few projects are still **works in progress**, so not everything here represents a final version.

I’m always exploring new ideas and improving my craft — feel free to browse around and reach out if you’d like to collaborate or learn more.
